A casual roguelike Android game with pixel-art. The focus of Dixel Pungeon is exploration.

Dixel Pungeon is based on Pixel Dungeon (see below). All credit and thanks to the watabou for making it open source.

Download: for now, get the latest binary (Android APK) here:

Source code:
- https://github.com/arfonzocoward/dixel-pungeon

Key changes:

It's easier when starting out and for casual playing:
- More focus on exploring levels to their fullest.
- More food: start with more food, and MOBs have a chance of dropping food.

It has elements from the Dark Souls series: soul collecting, campfires for resting and upgrades.
- Spend collected souls on upgrades.
- Explore and return to the safety of the campfire.

Other neat stuff:
- Drugs: find and consume drugs, to your benefit or detriment... responsibly!

Enjoy,
